# Email Cleaner

As my mailbox is getting full, I wanted to filter unwanted emails. There are some candidates like confirmation emails, one-time-passwords and commercial emails.

I tried two approaches:
- looking for keywords in the mail's address of the sender, subject and body
- using a LLM (LLama 2 in this case) to evaluate the importance of an email
